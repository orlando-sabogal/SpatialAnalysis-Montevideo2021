# Introduction to spatial analysis with R

*Montevideo (Uruguay) - October - 2021.*

This is a short course prepared for the **XIV Congreso Latinoamericano de sociedades de estadística CLATSE**

## Instructors

- Orlando Sabogal-Cardona - The Bartlett Development Planning Unit DPU, University College London
- María Eugenia Riaño - Profesora Adjunta - Departamento de Métodos Cuantitativos, FCEA - UdelaR

You can download all content (including tutorials with the source code) from [here](https://github.com/orlando-sabogal/SpatialAnalysis-Montevideo2021)

For a previous version of the course please visit [our 2019 repository](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-MontevideoWorkshop2019/)

This is a short course about using geographic data to generate maps and insights. We will see how to use the  **sf** library to load and process data by performing spatial operations. For map-making we are going to introduce the **tmap** library. Also, we will see how to create interactive maps with **leaflet.** <br/>

[Here](Presentations/spatial-analysis-presentation.html) you can find the slides to the introduction. <br/>

Nevertheless, most of the content is going to be delivered through three tutorials:

- [Warm Up - sf](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-Montevideo2021/Notebooks/WarmUp.nb.html)
- [tmap Tutorial](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-Montevideo2021/Notebooks/tmap-tutorial.nb.html)
- [Interactive maps](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-Montevideo2021/Notebooks/InteractiveMaps.nb.html)

I encourage you to go through the Notebooks and digest the code. Eventually, you can forget the details of every library or how a specific function works; but if you understand the logic and develop the intuition, it is easier to remember and to solve new problems.

Please let me know if you find any mistake or have a suggestion.
